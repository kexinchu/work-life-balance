- Responses to boredom
For John Eastwood, the central feature of boredom is that people cannot focus, due to a failure in what he calls the 'attention system', and as a result they become frustrated and irritable. His team suggests that those for whom **pleasure** is an important aim in life may have problems in coping with boredom, whereas those who have the characteristic of **curiosity** can generally cope with it.

People who are motivated by pleasure seem to suffer particularly badly. Other personality traits, such as curiosity, are associated with a high boredom threshold.
