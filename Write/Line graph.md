## Line graph 线图
    - 一般会有3-5条线，
    - 侧重于比较
        - 先做最一般性的比较(overview那一段)
        - 在特殊的节点上做比较，注意每条线都至少要提到1次

### 结构 <四段式>
- **paraphrase the question**
    - 改写 - 1句话
    - 举例：
        - the graph below shows  =  the line graph compares
        - (electricity) production = the amount of (electricity) produced   <名词转动词>
        - 将图中的线内容放进来: using four different sources of power
        - between 1980 and 2012 = over a period of 32 years
- **overview**
  - 做最general的比较，比如哪个最多，哪个最少这种
  - 2句话
  - 举例：
      - It is clear that nuclear power was **by far the most important means of electricity generation** over the period shown. 
      - Renewable provided the lowest amount of electricity in each year.
- **details**
  - 起始年份的所有折线都讲清楚
  - 内容太少，加上第一个折线交叉点的信息。
  - 注意不要使用图中直接给出的表达，需要改写
      - Nuclear power was used to produce 75 terawatt hours of electricity.
      - Nuclear power stations produced 75 terawatt hours of electricity.
  - 举例：
      - In 1980, **thermal power stations** were the main source of electricity in Grance, generating around 120 terawatt hours of power. **Nuclear and hydroelectric power stations** produced just under 75 terawatt hours of electricity each, and renewables provided **a negligible amount**.
      - Just one year later, nuclear power **overtook** thermal power as **the primary source of** electricity.
- **details**
  - 描述一下每条折线的趋势(大概的)
  - 注意做一些比较
  - 举例：
    - Nuclear， 上升趋势，在2005年达到峰值
    - Thermal， 下降趋势, 在1985年之后保持平稳
    - Hydroelectric, 整体上保持平稳
    - Renewable， 在最后几年开始上升
    Between 1980 and 2005, electricity production from nuclear power **rose dramatically to a peak of** 430 terawatt hours.
    **By contrast**, **the figure for** thermal power fell to only 50 terawatt hours in 1985, and **remained at this level** for the rest of the period.
    Hydroelectric power generation **remained relatively stable**, at between 50 and 80 terawatt hours, for the whole 32-years period.
    But renewable electricity production **saw only a small rise** to approximately 25 terawatt hours by 2012.
